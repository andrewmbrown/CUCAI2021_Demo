## Stock Options Volatility Prediction

### Andrew Brown, Alex Le Blanc, Smeet Chheda, Tanner Dunn

Stock markets can be incredible money-making tools, and have been for millions of people around the world. However, stock markets can be very volatile and unpredictable - especially with events such as the recent global pandemic taking place. Thus, a few months, our group set out to utilize time-series forecasting techniques to get a better sense of future market trends and empower investors to make more informed decisions.

As opposed to predicting whether a particular stock or index price is going to move up or down, we wanted to take a different approach to forecasting market trends. We decided to predict volatility. In other words, we wanted to predict likelihood and magnitude of change, with little regard to direction. Additionally, we wanted a strategy which would allow us to better hedge our bets. These decisions were motivated by the power of options, and achieved through the use of ARIMA forecasting models.
