        ## What are options?

        Stock market volatility has been a heavily 
        discussed topic ever since the inception of the market in the early 1600s. Most people assume that the only time
        anyone ever makes money is when stocks go up; however, this is far from the case. A profit can be made even when a stock gets
        bad news or sees itself in the midst of a \'market crash\'. A majority stocks have
        options contracts whose price is derived from the price of the stock. Options contracts present investors with the ability to 
        benefit from adverse movement's in an underlying securities\' price.

        ## Types of Options Contracts
        Regardless of the type of contract, all options contracts will have the two following things:
        - Strike Price
        - Expiry Date
        - Premium
        The strike price is the price at which the contract agreement is executed, whereas the expiry date
        acts the same way it does on a coupon. A buyer can, but is not obligated to, execute the contract at any point
        prior to expiry; however, once the contract has reached expiry, it is worthless. The premium can be thought of as the price
        of the contract. As the underlying stock price moves favorably with respect to the contract terms, the premium of the
        contract increases.
